# memorygame-react

This is the memory game from The Net Ninja's React and Firebase Course.
Though I made some changes:

* Added a leaderboard
* Hooked up the leaderboard with backend using Supabase
* Doubled the amount of cards and changed them to food icons
* Added a congratulation component with fireworks effects
* Resized the grid and added some text and a footer
