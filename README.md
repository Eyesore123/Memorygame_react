# Memory Game

This is a memory game from The Net Ninja's React and Firebase Course.
Though I made some changes:

* Added a leaderboard; added Gamestats and Leaderboard components
* Hooked up the leaderboard with backend using Supabase
* Doubled the amount of cards and changed them to food icons
* Added a congratulation modal with fireworks effects
* Resized the grid and added some text and a footer
* Added a fake loader for the start of the game

Doesn't require a sign-up. So fire up the game and get your name on the leaderboard!
